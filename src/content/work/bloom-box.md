Jerry's Escape is a 3rd person Unity game that I created with a team of 5 developers during a CodeCamp project. We had only 1 week to complete the project and we divided the tasks among team members according to their strengths. My responsibilities included character modeling and animation, as well as game menus.

The objective of the game is for the player to help Jerry, the main character, escape from a maze of obstacles and enemies. To accomplish this, the player must use various skills such as jumping, dodging, and shooting to overcome the challenges and progress through the levels.

One of the biggest challenges we faced during development was compatibility issues with different machines and software. However, we worked together to quickly resolve these issues and catch up on the project timeline. In the end, we were able to deliver a fully playable and enjoyable game experience.

We developed the game using Unity game engine and C# programming language. The game features a variety of game mechanics, including physics-based movement, enemy AI, and interactive objects. We also incorporated sound effects and music to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Overall, the development of Jerry's Escape was a great learning experience for me and my team. It allowed us to gain valuable skills in game development, teamwork, problem-solving, and time management. The project challenged us to think creatively and efficiently to create a fun and engaging game within a limited timeframe.
