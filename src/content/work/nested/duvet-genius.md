TurboHébergé is an e-commerce site that I recently developed. I was responsible for creating both the front-end and back-end of the site. For the front-end, I used React with TypeScript and Sass to create an intuitive and attractive user interface for the site's users. For the back-end, I chose Node.js with Express and TypeScript to ensure high performance and scalability of the site.

The main goal of the site is to sell VPS subscriptions to its users. The site is designed to allow users to choose from different subscription plans and easily proceed with their online purchase. To achieve this, I used features such as secure online payments, subscription management, and user interface customization options to improve the user experience.

The project was carried out in collaboration with a colleague from the same program. We worked together to overcome challenges related to creating an e-commerce site, such as setting up inventory management, security, and online transaction management. We encountered some issues on the back-end, but we were able to quickly resolve them by working as a team.

The TurboHébergé project was completed in just 5 weeks. We worked collaboratively to ensure the project was delivered within the given timeframe. We also adhered to quality and security standards for web development, which allowed us to deliver a reliable and highly functional end product.

Overall, this project was a rewarding learning experience for me as a full-stack web developer. It allowed me to gain skills in web development, project management, teamwork, and problem-solving.
